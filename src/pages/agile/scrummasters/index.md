## Scrum Master

The Scrum Master is responsible for making sure that Scrum is understood and
enacted. He is the servant-leader for the Scrum Team, with the goal to help the
team maximize the value created by the team.

The Scrum Master is responsible for:
- the process
- the team
- continuous improvement of both

Typically the Scrum Master plans and facilitates all Scrum related meetings:
- Daily Scrum
- Sprint Planning
- Sprint Review
- Sprint Retrospective

He knows and understands the Scrum process and agile mindset behind it. He has
the authority over the process and ensures that the team adheres to it.

He is responsible for removing impediments. An impediment is anything that keeps
the team from getting work done and slows them down.

The Scrum Master should also act as a coach to the team and the organization.

It is important to note, that the Scrum Master is not a project manager or
team lead!
